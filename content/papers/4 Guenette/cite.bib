journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
abstract = {In this paper we explore the potential improvements in   neutrino event reconstruction that a 3D pixelated readout could   offer over a 2D projective wire readout for liquid argon time   projection chambers. We simulate and study events in two generic,   idealized detector configurations for these two designs, classifying   events in each sample with deep convolutional neural networks to   compare the best 2D results to the best 3D results. In almost all   cases we find that the 3D readout provides better reconstruction   efficiency and purity than the 2D projective wire readout, with the   advantages of 3D being particularly evident in more complex   topologies, such as electron neutrino charged current events. We   conclude that the use of a 3D pixelated detector could significantly   enhance the reach and impact of future liquid argon TPC experiments   physics program, such as DUNE.}
